<h2>Assignment 1: Picasso - Les Demoiselles d'Avignon </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </h4>

<p>
  The goal of this assignment was to take multiple images of either yourself, or friends, & duplicate a minimum of three figures from the Picasso painting <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon </i>, which is shown below. <br>
  <img src="picasso.jpg" style = "width:30%"> <br>
  The first of these images was to be coloured in any way we chose, but must have had a green background. <br>
  <img src="LakhdhirSabrinaAssignment1A.jpg" style="width:60%"> <br> 
  The second, again, was to be coloured in any way we chose, but must have had a grayscale background. <br>
  <img src="LakhdhirSabrinaAssignment1B.jpg" style="width:60%"> <br>
  <br>
  Working through this assignment allowed me to become more familiar with various tools on photoshop such as: hues and saturation (among other filters), layering, fill, and lasso, to name the most used ones.
