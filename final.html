<h2>Assignment 8: Interaction </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </h4>

<p>
		My focus for the final project was inspired by the following photographers: <br>
		- Brandon Woelfel <br>
		- Scott Kelby <br>
		- Tim Flech <br>
		<br>
		My goal was to take pictures taken myself, and edit them to produce more interesting & abstract images.
		I wanted to maintain some aspects of their realistic-ness, while also adding elements to make them appear surreal. <br>
		<br>
		The desired effects were achieved through the use of multiple layers and filters including, but not limited to 
		hue and saturation, posterize, pixelating, black and white, opacity, and gradients. <br>
		<br>
		Find the images in the following slideshow:

	<h4> <i> Extension #1: Extreme Photoshop <i><h4>
	<p>
	In order to further my photoshop work, I created two images which have a sort of narrative attached to their visual. <br>
	
	The first image is meant to mimic a clock in telling the story of the life cycle of a rose. This image makes excessive use of photo filters, layering, opacity, and hue/saturation. <br>
	The images of the roses on the bottom half of the image were taken off the internet and altered to create the cyclic, clock-like appearance. <br> 
	<img src="LakhdhirSabrinaAssignment5.jpg" style="width:50%"> 
	
	<br>
	The second image is just a simple motion-capture type layered image of myself at the Peace Bridge in downtown Calgary. This image made use of selective colour tools, layering, lasso tools, and black and white photo filters. <br> 
	<img src="sabrina.jpg" style="width:50%">
	</p>
	
	<h4> <i> Extension #2: Gifs <i><h4>
	<p>
	A second way I decided to work on my photoshopped images some more was by creating gifs which show the transition from the original image to the edited image. I produced gifs of two images. I chose these two specific images
	because I liked the subtle, yet striking difference which was created using the multitude of photoshop filters. I wanted the gifs to highlight the steps taken in creating the filtered images. <br>
	<table>
	  	<tr>
		<td><img src="pandaGIF.gif" width="300" height="200"></td>
		<td><img src="bridgeGif.gif" width="300" height="150"></td>
  	</tr>
	</table>
