<h2>Assignment 8: Interaction </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </h4>

<p>
		My focus for the final project was inspired by the following photographers: <br>
		- Brandon Woelfel <br>
		- Scott Kelby <br>
		- Tim Flech <br>
		<br>
		My goal was to take pictures taken myself, and edit them to produce more interesting & abstract images.
		I wanted to maintain some aspects of their realistic-ness, while also adding elements to make them appear surreal. <br>
		<br>
		The desired effects were achieved through the use of multiple layers and filters including, but not limited to 
		hue and saturation, posterize, pixelating, black and white, opacity, and gradients. <br>
		<br>
		Find the images in the following slideshow:

		<td><img src="Peace Bridge 1.jpg" style="width:40%"></td>
  	</tr>
	</table>

	Additionally, please find the edited images below: <br>
		<table>
	<tr>
		<td> <img src="butterlyEdited.jpg" style="width:30%"> </td>
		<td><img src="pandaEdited.jpg" style="width:30%"></td>
		<td><img src="peacockEdited.jpg" style="width:30%"></td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
		<td><img src="peaceBridge2edited.jpg" style="width:40%"></td>
		<td><img src="peaceBridgeEdited.jpg" style="width:40%"></td>
  	</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	
	I decided to work on my photoshopped images further by creating gifs which show the transition from the original image to the edited image. I produced gifs of two images. I chose these two specific images
	because I liked the subtle, yet striking difference which was created using the multitude of photoshop filters. I wanted the gifs to highlight the steps taken in creating the filtered images. <br>
	<table>
	  	<tr>
		<td><img src="pandaGIF.gif" style="width:40%"></td>
		<td><img src="bridgeGif.gif" style="width:40%"></td>
  	</tr>
	</table>
