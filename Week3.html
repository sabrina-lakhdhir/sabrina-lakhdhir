<h2>Assignment 3: Design a Net Art Piece </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </h4>

<p>
I would like to create a piece of informational art which take statistics about prospective jobs and prospective students, as well as graduating students, and creates 
artwork which can be used to compare and contrast patterns, differences, and similarities between the sets of data. <br>
Some of the information required to produce this piece would include: </p>
<ul class="a">
  <li> Number of prospective university students for the year
  <li> Breakdown of new students per faculty for the year - breakdown by department would be an interesting extension
  <li> Number of open job positions for the year 
  <li> Breakdown of job openings by field (would want these fields to match the faculties) - breakdown into specific areas would also provide another interesting extension
  <li> Number of university students graduating for the year 
</ul>
<br>
Using the above information, I would want to create interactive graphs, such as the example shown in class, 
from which data can be pooled together or broken down, however the viewer would like to see it. <br>
To explain this concept further, the total number of undergraduate students at a given universitiy would be the starting point of the art/graph. 
Tapping on it would break the bubble into multiple bubbles, where each bubble corresponds to a faculty. Each faculty would also be assigned a color
for aesthetic, as well as readability purposes. Each faculty could then be broken down into departments as well. In the case of departments, color
difference would still exist, but they would be in shades, rather than completely different colors. <br>
A similar set up would exist for the jobs, and jobs which fall under each faculty range would be grouped together and colored the same as that faculty 
to allow for easy comparison between the two.
