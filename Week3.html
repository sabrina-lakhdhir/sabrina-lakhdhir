<h2><center>Assignment 3: Design a Net Art Piece </center></h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"><center> <i> Fall 2018 </i></center> </h4>

<p> <center>
I would like to create a piece of art which takes an individual's search items and produces a sort of web. The produced web would consist of the current searched term, as well as other, similar terms. 
The user would see a visualization of this web as shown below: <br>
<img src="web2.JPG" style="width:50%" class="center"> <br>
The word which the individual had entered into the search will appear in one colour, while all other related terms will appear in a different colour, in varying shades and sizes based on their search frequency.
<br>
<br>
When clicking on a search term, the user will be provided with an image of the term, a thesaurus link, and a dictionary link, thus making this not only an appealing visual piece of art, but also an informational piece of art. Below is an example: <br>
<img src="web.JPG" style="width:50%"class="center">
