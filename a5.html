<h2><center>Assignment 5: Leonardo da Vinci - Clock</center> </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"><center> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </center></h4>

<p><center>
The goal of this assignment was to mimic Leonardo da Vinci's painting <i>Vitruvian Man </i>, but using ourselves and having 
the two sides of the clock contrast one another. <br>
In my interpretation of this assignment, I decided to focus the attention on a single rose which is in full bloom 
on the upper half of the clock, but as you travel around the clock, it slowly starts to lose petals and die. <br>
The contrasting colours also give a sense of darkness to the image and ensure emphasis is placed on the rose rather than on other 
objects in the image. <br>
