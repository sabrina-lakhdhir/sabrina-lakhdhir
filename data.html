	<h3><center>University of Calgary Undergraduate Enrolment</center> </h3>
	<p> <center>
        The first part of this project was to find a dataset to work with over the course of the semester. <br> <br>
        The data I have chosen to work with examines the University of Calgary's undergraduate enrolment numbers. The data is collected by the admissions office/registrar and contains details re-garding faculty, major, degree stream, and year of study (from first to fifth, while also containing an 'other' column). The data is also sorted by gender; each year of study has numbers split into male and female numbers. <br><br>
        I have collected data for 3 academic years, 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17. From these years, I decided to not look at specifics regarding combined degrees (I kept a total count for those with combined degrees in the same faculty but completely disregarded those with combined degrees across multiple faculties). Going forwards, if there is a need for more data, it can found at: https://oia.ucalgary.ca/fact-books/fact-book-20162017. <br><br>
        I think this data is interesting to work with because it allows us to understand various trends which exist with prospective students in our own university. Due to the detail provided, these trends can be seen over a short time period, over years of study, as well as either with, or without, a gender split. <br>
