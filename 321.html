<h3> <center>Web Art: Theory and Practice </center></h3>
<p><center>
Examination of the work of Net-based artists and investigation of the Internet as a vehicle to extend
art and design practice. 
Note: Internet art (often referred to as net art) is a form of digital artwork distributed via the Internet.
The term Internet art typically does not refer to art that has been simply digitized and uploaded to be
viewable over the Internet. This can be done through a web browser, such as images of paintings
uploaded for viewing in an online gallery. Rather, this genre relies intrinsically on the Internet to
exist, taking advantage of such aspects as an interactive interface and connectivity to multiple social
and economic cultures and micro-cultures. It refers to the Internet as a whole, not only to web-based
works.
