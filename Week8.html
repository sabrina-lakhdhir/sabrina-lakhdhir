<h2>Assignment 8: Interaction </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </h4>

 <h4>Chosen Interaction: Everyday the Same Dream <br> </h4>

  <br>
<b>1. How does the allowed interacton keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches? </b><br>
<br>
  By limiting the objects in the interactive piece that the user is allowed to interact with, the artist is able to ensure the user stays on track
  with a somewhat consistent story, regardless of the choices they make. Nonetheless, it still allows for variations and branches off the main 
  story line by allowing users to choose if they interact with objects, as well as by allowing users to choose when they interact with some objects. <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story. </b><br>
<br>
  By having a simple and grayscale graphical design, the simplicity of the narrative is maintained in its visual appearance. I believe this is relevant to the story 
  because it ensures the focus is placed on interactable objects, changes in these objects based on the users choices, as well as the interactions
  and user's character interactions. The simplicity also helped to emphasize the "dream-like" narrative of the interaction.<br>
  For example, the grayscale visual appearance allows emphasis to be placed on any colours that appear due to interaction and/or any movement which is either 
  a result of interactions or by interactable objects. Some examples of this include the flashing alarm clock, the TV screen, and the colour of the elevator button.<br>
  <br>
<b>3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. </b><br>
  <br>
  The interaction itself is quite short and limited. Personally, this influenced my chhoices because I attempted to interact with the art in as many ways as possible, whether it
  showed as an option or not. Finding that only a few objects were interactable was somewhat disappointing because it meant the art was extremely simple and had very 
  few possible branches and final outcomes. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Description of actions taken and their results AND description of the branches the story takes because of your choices. </b><br><br>
