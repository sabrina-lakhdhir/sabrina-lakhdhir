<h2><center>Assignment 8: Interaction </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <i> Fall 2018 </i> </center></h4>

<p><center>
 <h4>Chosen Interaction: Everyday the Same Dream <br> </h4>
  <br>
  <b>1. How does the allowed interacton keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches? </b><br>
  <br>
  By limiting the objects that the user is allowed to interact with, the artist is able to ensure the user stays on track
  with a somewhat consistent story, regardless of the choices they make. Nonetheless, the narrative still allows for variations and branches off of the main 
  story line by allowing users to choose <i>if</i> they interact with certain objects, as well as by allowing users to choose <i>when</i> they interact with some objects. <br>
  <br>
  The narrative is built on a sort of <i> if-then</i> basis, meaning, <b> if </b> some action is taken, then something specific may or may not happen, <b> else </b>, something else may or may not happen.
  The choices the user makes on what objects to interact with, in turn, influence the latter of each dream. When the user decides to interact with certain objects, a specific series of events will take place. If they choose otherwise, the day's sequence of events will continue
  in no special fashion until the remainder of the day has been travelled through and the new day begins. A new day presents another opportunity for the user to travel down a new interaction path.
  <br> <br>
  <b>2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story. </b><br>
  <br>
  By having a grayscale graphical design which lacks details, the simplicity of the narrative is maintained in its visual appearance. I believe this is relevant to the story 
  because it ensures the focus is placed on interactable objects, changes in these objects based on the users choices, as well as the interactions which take place between the user and other characters in the narrative.
  The simplicity also helped to emphasize the "dream-like" narrative of the interaction.<br>
  For example, the grayscale visual appearance allows emphasis to be placed on any colours that appear due to interaction and/or any movement which is either 
  a result of interactions or by interactable objects. Some examples of this include the flashing alarm clock, the TV screen, and the colour of the elevator button.<br>
  <br>
  <b>3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. </b><br>
  <br>
  The interaction itself is quite short and limited. Personally, this influenced my choices because I attempted to interact with the art in as many ways as possible, whether it
  showed as an interactable item or not. Finding that only a few objects were interactable was somewhat disappointing because it meant the art was extremely simple and had very 
  few possible branches and final outcomes. <br>
  However, the narrative itself was quite dark. This can be said due to the fact that most scenes ended with something that is not exactly desirable. For example, the hobo took the character
  to a cemetery, and that was the end of that scene. A second example would be when the character shows up to work undressed and the dream ends with his boss firing him. A third example would be 
  when the character is told to go to his cubicle, but instead walks out of the building and his only remaining option is to jump off the roof. <br>
  No matter the choices made by the user, there was always a negative ending to the dream, and this could cause the player to become shocked, or depressed, as many of the dream endings are not things 
  witnessed in day to day life. <br>
