        The next part of this project required an implementation of the information visualization. Before beginning to code, 
        I created a mockup on Photoshop of what I would like my final presentation to look like. Please find it below: <br>

        </center> </p>

        <h4> <center> Variation 1</center> </h4>
        <p> <center>My first attempt at implementing this visualization was to create a presentation which shows a comparison of the sizes of different faculties. 
        I kept this one simple & used a simple circle to represent each faculty, ensuring that colour was used to differentiate between them.<br>

        <h4> <center> Variation 2</center> </h4>
        <p> <center> 
            In my second variation, my goal was to replace the circles with a silhouette headshot of a graduate. However, due to a time limitation
            and an unforeseen lack of knowledge, I was not able to successfully implement this variation for this hand-in deadline. <br>

        <h4> <center> Variation 3</center> </h4>
        <p> <center> 
            My third variation follows suit of my second, and is somewhat an extension on it, thus, due to being unable to complete the second variation, I was also 
            unable to complete this one. <br>
            In my third variation, I was hoping to switch out the simple graduate silhouette for a silhouette of either a male graduate or a female graduate, dependant on enrolment numbers by 
            gender in that faculty. I think this would be an interesting variation as it is something small and subtle, yet provides the viewer with an additional piece of information 
            at first sight - that piece of information being which gender "rules" the faculty. <br>
