        The second step of this project was to develop a set of sketches using the 10 + 10 method. <br> 
        <br> </center>

        <h4> <center>Sketchable Subset</center></h4>
<p> <center>
        Before beginning to sketch, the first step was to develop a sketchable subset which provides a variable and accurate representation of the data.
        Below find the subset created for the purposes of this project. <br> <br>

<h4> <center>Design Direction in Sketches</center></h4>
<p> <center>
        In my sketches, my goal was to capture the idea of comparing faculties to begin with. I then wanted to introduce interactions such that, by tapping on a faculty in the respective presenta-tion/visualization design, you would receive information about all the departments in that facul-ty. Furthermore, when tapping on a specific department, you would receive more information regarding the gender ratios for that specific department. Another extension which can be added, which I did not include in either my sketches or my subset, is comparing the degree stream (for example, a BSc in Psychology vs a BA in Psychology) <br> <br>
        I tried to show these ideas in my initial sketches mostly through the idea of presenting and com-paring each of the faculties by size. I used multiple variations of comparing by size. Some in-clude: bubbles, people, and text. In my refined sketches, I built on these ideas by showing the results of an interaction with the base visualization. <br> <br>

<h4> <center>Initial 10 Sketches</center></h4>
<p> <center>
        My initial set of sketches focused on different ways to display the data in general, with a focus being on making it easily readable. 
        In my initial sketches, I considered showing trends in enrolment numbers over a 3 year period, as well as just comparing enrolment numbers between faculties.
