<h2><center>Assignment 4: Create a Sculpture Composed of a Mix of Objects</center> </h2>
<h4 style="color:gray"> <center><i> Fall 2018 </i> </center></h4>

<p class="textBox"><center>
This assignment was completed in a group of three students. The goal was to create a sculpture 
of some sort which showcased multiple features including a scaffolding, a skin, a texutre, and a ______? <br>
We attempted to create an image which showcases a bit of a story, or lifeline. <br>
There are dead fish at the top, which would be caught by the whale, who is the main object in our image. <br>
The whale also has seaweed in his mouth, along with fish feeding on those plants. The whale is then caught in a net, which 
represents being caught by humans, thus representing an entire cycle in nature. <br>
